# waydroid-nvidia

**GPU-accelerated Waydroid on the NVIDIA driver — container-native, no VM.
Needs the open kernel modules (`nvidia-open`); the userspace stays NVIDIA's
regular proprietary stack.**

Stock Waydroid can't render on NVIDIA. This project proxies Vulkan (Mesa
Venus) over a unix socket to a host-side renderer that issues the real Vulkan
calls — Android x86 and x86_64 app processes render on your NVIDIA GPU,
CUDA/NVENC and full performance stay intact, everything remains a container:

```
Android app ── Vulkan ──▶ guest Mesa Venus ── unix socket ──▶ host renderer
                                                                   │
KWin ◀── hwcomposer ◀── gralloc imports ◀── NVIDIA dmabufs ◀── NVIDIA driver
```

Buffers are allocated host-side as NVIDIA block-linear images and travel to
the compositor as native NVIDIA dmabufs — no cross-vendor negotiation, no
copies. GL runs through ANGLE, ASTC textures are emulated in a compute shader
(desktop NVIDIA lacks the hardware Android mandates), and frame sync is fully
GPU-side (timeline syncobjs + imported sync_fd semaphores; zero per-frame
socket roundtrips). The guest runs native high refresh — 500 Hz verified,
with a translated ARM game holding 500 fps at 2 ms present-to-present.

Verified in the field on Turing, Ampere, Ada and Blackwell GPUs. Real games
tested: Minecraft Bedrock, Subway Surfers, Arknights, Honkai: Star Rail —
plus Google Play certification and ARM translation (libhoudini).

## Requirements

- **NVIDIA open kernel modules** (`nvidia-open`/`nvidia-open-dkms`) — the
  closed module has no DMA-BUF support, and every displayed buffer here is
  one. The userspace (`nvidia-utils`) is the same proprietary code either
  way; nouveau/NVK is out of scope (stock Waydroid handles it). Open KM
  means **Turing (RTX 20 / GTX 16) or newer**.
- Driver **595.71+** (610.x recommended) with **`nvidia-drm.modeset=1`**.
- A Wayland session (tested on KWin / Plasma 6) and the usual Waydroid
  kernel bits (binder).
- Unsure about a machine? `tests/run-probe.sh` checks the exact
  buffer-sharing paths in ~30 s and names anything missing — see
  [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Install (Arch / AUR)

```sh
yay -S waydroid-nvidia-bin        # provides/conflicts: waydroid
waydroid init                     # download an Android image, as usual
sudo waydroid-nvidia-setup        # add --refresh <hz> to match your monitor
sudo systemctl enable --now waydroid-container.service
systemctl --user enable --now wd-venus.service
# re-log-in once (udev rule for /dev/udmabuf), then:
waydroid session start            # or launch Waydroid from the app menu
```

`waydroid-nvidia-setup` deploys the guest stack, writes the config, verifies
your environment (modeset, vendor image, render node) and removes stale
config left by older installs. Safe to re-run any time — it's also the first
thing to try when something misbehaves. Verify acceleration:

```sh
sudo waydroid shell dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep GLES
# GLES: ... ANGLE (NVIDIA, Vulkan ... Venus (NVIDIA GeForce ...))
sudo waydroid shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abilist
# x86_64,x86,... means Houdini can translate ARM32-only apps into the x86 path
```

**If your compositor is not on the NVIDIA GPU** (monitors connected to
another GPU, iGPU-driven laptop panel): the compositor can't display this
stack's NVIDIA buffers and the Waydroid window dies instantly. The workaround
is running Waydroid nested inside gamescope pinned to the NVIDIA GPU, so
compositing happens on NVIDIA and gamescope hands your desktop something it
can display. Needs `gamescope` and `wayland-utils`:

```sh
waydroid session stop; sleep 5
W=$(wayland-info | grep -B1 'flags: current' | grep -oP 'width:\s*\K\d+' | head -1)
H=$(wayland-info | grep -B1 'flags: current' | grep -oP 'height:\s*\K\d+' | head -1)
GPU=$(lspci -nn | grep -Ei 'vga|3d' | grep -i nvidia | grep -oP '\[\K10de:[0-9a-f]{4}' | head -1)
gamescope -f -W "$W" -H "$H" --prefer-vk-device "$GPU" -- \
  sh -c 'WAYLAND_DISPLAY=$GAMESCOPE_WAYLAND_DISPLAY exec waydroid show-full-ui'
```

Launch apps from inside Android while nested (`waydroid app launch` swaps the
window and crashes gamescope). **Broken on hybrid Intel+NVIDIA laptops right
now** — gamescope crashes and takes the host session down with it
(issue #2, upstream gamescope#1590); hybrid support is being worked on there.

**NixOS:** community flake —
[yigexuanmu/waydroid-nvidia-nix](https://github.com/yigexuanmu/waydroid-nvidia-nix).
**Other distros:** the same binaries install anywhere — see
[`docs/install-manual.md`](docs/install-manual.md).

**Releases are fully attested**: every asset is CI-built from pinned sources
and carries SLSA provenance —
`gh attestation verify <asset> --repo Shiro836/waydroid-nvidia`.

## Limitations & roadmap

Not yet supported: ETC2 texture emulation (ASTC is; affected games show
placeholder textures), ASTC readback (uploads/sampling work), RGBA_FP16
gralloc buffers. dma_buf mmap read bandwidth is below native (readback paths
only). Planned: self-contained guest image published as an OTA channel,
shared-memory ring transport, ETC2, input-to-photon measurement.
